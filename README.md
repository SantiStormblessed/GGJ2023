# SUA

In an ancient land of Muisca capybaras, a village had the urge to send a message to the Sun. They need the fastest Sua; a mythic Macaw that had the abilities to reach the Sun through the Home Tree. Face your friends on a 1v1 race and find out which of you is the better Sua, climbing up the tree, leaves and various other platforms, where you have to avoid arrows of the natives, stones of the highest mountains and even sunrays sent by the Muisca's gods! Get yourself into the cultural roots of an ancient Colombia and be the first to reach the Sun and deliver the message of the Muisca capybaras.
